this python challenge about Smart Playlist Intelligence System
we should do this:
      1. Accepts a list of song durations
      2. Uses Python logic + inbuilt functions to analyze the playlist
      3. Categorizes the playlist
      4. Produces a final recommendation
and for validation : any thing that have -ve durations is invalid


playist Analysis:
        Too Short Playlist
        Total duration &lt; 300 seconds
        Too Long Playlist
        Total duration &gt; 3600 seconds
        Repetitive Playlist
        If the same duration appears more than once
        Balanced Playlist
       If:
       No invalid entries
       Not too short or too long
       No repetition
       Duration values vary reasonably
      Irregular Playlist
      Any playlist that does not fit the above categories
